# 🤔 Understanding APIs

---

## What Does an API Do?

An **API** acts as a bridge between different software applications, allowing them to communicate and share data or functionality. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications use to interact with each other.

---

## 🛠️ Key Concepts

- **Endpoints:** Specific URLs where API services are accessed.
- **Requests & Responses:** Communication between client and server using HTTP methods.
- **Authentication:** Ensures only authorized users can access the API.
- **Rate Limiting:** Controls how many requests a client can make in a given time.

## 🔍 How to Use an API

1. **Find the API documentation.**
2. **Get access credentials (API key, token, etc.).**
3. **Make requests to endpoints using tools like Postman, curl, or Python scripts.**
4. **Handle responses and errors in your application.**

## 🧪 Interactive Example: Calling an API with Python

Let's see how you can interact with a public API using Python and the `requests` library.

```python
import requests

# Example: Fetch weather data for Delhi
url = "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=28.61&longitude=77.23&current_weather=true"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
	data = response.json()
	print("Current temperature in Delhi:", data['current_weather']['temperature'], "°C")
else:
	print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

**Try it yourself:**
- Copy the code into a Python file and run it.
- Change the latitude/longitude for other cities.

## 🧭 Tips for Working with APIs

- Always read the documentation carefully.
- Test endpoints with sample data.
- Secure your API keys and tokens.
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
- Use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl for quick testing.

## 🌟 Popular Tools for API Testing

- **Postman**: User-friendly interface for building and testing API requests.
- **Insomnia**: Powerful REST client for debugging APIs.
- **curl**: Command-line tool for making HTTP requests.
