# ðŸš¦ Working of an API: Deep Dive with Diagrams

---

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern software communication. They enable different systems to interact, share data, and trigger actions. Letâ€™s explore the working of an API in detail, step by step, with technical theory and diagrams.

## 1. Request Initiation

**Theory:**

- The client (browser, mobile app, IoT device, or another server) initiates a request to the API, typically using HTTP/HTTPS.
- The request includes:
	- **Method:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.
	- **Headers:** Metadata (e.g., authentication tokens, content type).
	- **Body:** Data payload (for POST/PUT requests).
- Requests can be synchronous (wait for response) or asynchronous (callback/webhook).

**Example:**
```http
GET https://api.example.com/v1/weather?city=Delhi
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
		participant UserApp
		participant API
		UserApp->>API: Initiate Request (GET /weather)
```

## 2. API Endpoint

**Theory:**

- The request is directed to a specific API endpoint (URL) that represents a resource or service.
- Endpoints are organized by resource type and versioning (e.g., /v1/users, /v2/products).
- Endpoints may require authentication and support query parameters for filtering/sorting.

**Example:**
- `/v1/weather?city=Delhi` is an endpoint for weather data in Delhi.

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
	A[Client] -- Request --> B[API Endpoint /v1/weather]
	B -- Forward Request --> C[API Server]
```

## 3. Request Processing

**Theory:**

- The API server receives the request and processes it through several layers:
	- **Authentication:** Verifies user identity (API key, OAuth, JWT).
	- **Validation:** Checks request format, required fields, and permissions.
	- **Business Logic:** Executes core functions (calculations, rules).
	- **Database/Service Calls:** Fetches or updates data from databases or external services.
- May include logging, caching, and error handling.

**Example:**
- The server checks if the city exists, validates the token, fetches weather data from a database or external API.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
flowchart LR
		A[API Server] --> B[Auth Layer]
		B --> C[Validation Layer]
		C --> D[Business Logic]
		D --> E[Database/API Call]
```

## 4. Response Generation

**Theory:**

- After processing, the API generates a response:
	- **Status Code:** 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error), etc.
	- **Headers:** Content-Type, CORS, etc.
	- **Body:** Data in JSON, XML, or other formats.
- The response is sent back to the client, which then processes or displays the data.

**Example:**
```json
{
	"city": "Delhi",
	"temperature": 34,
	"condition": "Sunny"
}
```

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
		participant API
		participant Client
		API-->>Client: Response (JSON, Status Code)
```

## 5. End-to-End API Workflow

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
		participant Client
		participant API_Server
		participant Auth
		participant DB
		Client->>API_Server: Request (GET /weather?city=Delhi)
		API_Server->>Auth: Authenticate Request
		Auth-->>API_Server: Auth Success/Fail
		API_Server->>DB: Query weather data
		DB-->>API_Server: Weather data
		API_Server-->>Client: JSON Response
```

## Key Takeaways

- APIs follow a multi-step workflow: request initiation, endpoint targeting, layered processing, and response.
- Each step involves specific protocols, logic, and data formats for reliability and security.
- Diagrams help visualize the flow and interactions between components.
- Understanding this flow is essential for designing, debugging, and consuming APIs effectively.
