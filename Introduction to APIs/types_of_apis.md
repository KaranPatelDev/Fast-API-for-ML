# üèóÔ∏è Types of APIs: In-Depth Guide with Examples

---

## What Are API Types?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are categorized by their intended audience, access level, and technical design. Choosing the right API type is crucial for security, scalability, and integration.

---

## 1. **Web API**

**Definition:**
Web APIs are interfaces that allow applications to communicate over the web (HTTP/HTTPS). They are typically RESTful or use GraphQL, and are accessible via URLs.

**Theory:**
- Web APIs expose endpoints for clients to send requests and receive responses, often in JSON or XML format.
- They are stateless and scalable, making them ideal for cloud and distributed systems.

**Examples:**
- Twitter API: Fetch tweets, post updates.
- Google Maps API: Get geolocation and map data.

**Mermaid Diagram:**
```mermaid

	participant Server
	Client->>WebAPI: GET /weather?city=Delhi
	WebAPI->>Server: Query weather data
	Server-->>WebAPI: Weather data
	WebAPI-->>Client: JSON response
```

---

## 2. **Library API**

**Definition:**
Library APIs are sets of functions, classes, or methods provided by a software library for use in code. They are accessed locally within the same application or environment.

**Theory:**
- Library APIs abstract complex operations, making it easier for developers to use advanced features without knowing the internal implementation.
- They are language-specific and often come with documentation and examples.

**Examples:**
- NumPy (Python): Mathematical operations on arrays.
- jQuery (JavaScript): DOM manipulation and AJAX calls.

**Mermaid Diagram:**
```mermaid

	A[Your Code] --> B[Library API]
	B --> C[Library Functions]
```

---

## 3. **Remote API**

**Definition:**
Remote APIs are designed to interact with systems located on a different network or server, often through the internet or intranet.

**Theory:**
- Web API is a subset of Remote API (all Web APIs are Remote APIs, but not all Remote APIs are Web APIs).
- Remote APIs can also include Intranet APIs, accessible only within a private network.

**Examples:**
- Deploying virtual machines using AWS EC2 API.
- Retrieving remote files stored in Google Drive through its API.

**Mermaid Diagram:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant App
	participant RemoteAPI
	participant RemoteServer
	App->>RemoteAPI: Request data
	RemoteAPI->>RemoteServer: Fetch data
	RemoteServer-->>RemoteAPI: Data
	RemoteAPI-->>App: Response
```

---

## 4. **Database API**

**Definition:**
Database APIs allow applications to interact with databases, providing a structured way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**Theory:**
- Database APIs abstract the underlying database queries, making it easier to manage data securely and efficiently.
- They support both SQL and NoSQL databases.

**Examples:**
- MySQL Connector API: Enables interaction with MySQL databases.
- MongoDB API: Allows CRUD operations on NoSQL data.
- Firebase Realtime Database API: Facilitates real-time database interactions.

**Mermaid Diagram:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant App
	participant DBAPI
	participant Database
	App->>DBAPI: INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE
	DBAPI->>Database: SQL/NoSQL Query
	Database-->>DBAPI: Result
	DBAPI-->>App: Response
```

---

## 5. **Hardware API**

**Definition:**
Hardware APIs allow software to interact with hardware devices, such as sensors, printers, cameras, or GPUs.

**Theory:**
- Hardware APIs provide functions to send commands, read data, or control hardware features.
- They often require drivers or low-level system access.

**Examples:**
- OpenGL API: Interact with graphics hardware for rendering.
- Windows Printer API: Send print jobs to printers.
- Android Camera API: Capture images and video.

**Mermaid Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
	A[App] --> B[Hardware API]
	B --> C[Device Driver]
	C --> D[Hardware Device]
```

---

## 6. **GUI API**

**Definition:**
GUI (Graphical User Interface) APIs allow developers to create and manage graphical interfaces, such as windows, buttons, and menus.

**Theory:**
- GUI APIs abstract the complexity of drawing and event handling, making it easier to build interactive applications.
- They are platform-specific (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android) or cross-platform (e.g., Qt, Tkinter).

**Examples:**
- Tkinter (Python): Build desktop GUI applications.
- Java Swing: Create windows and controls in Java.
- Electron (JavaScript): Build cross-platform desktop apps.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

	A[App Code] --> B[GUI API]

	C --> D[User Interface]

**Use Cases:**

- Travel booking (flights, hotels, car rentals in one call)
- E-commerce checkout processes
- Dashboard data aggregation

**Example:**

```http
POST https://api.booking.com/v1/composite
{
	"flight": { "from": "DEL", "to": "NYC" },
	"hotel": { "city": "NYC", "nights": 3 },
	"car": { "type": "SUV" }
}
```

**Pros:**

- Reduces network overhead
- Simplifies client logic
- Improves performance

**Cons:**

- Can be complex to design and maintain
- Debugging can be harder
